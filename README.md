# Training_and_Placement_Management_System


The “Online Training and Placement Management System” is an online application that can be accessed throughout the organization and outside as well with proper login provided. It offers many flexible and convenient features, allowing admin, students and company to cooperate well. The main purpose is to overcome the problem of managing records of all three entities in physical documents. 

The application is designed to provide ease while inputting any data. It also supports 'validation', so that incorrect information is not inputed. It is extremely user friendly, and is encouraged to be used by less technically able people.
This system also allows to update information for students and companies, incase of any changes. The admin sees both the sides, the companies and students, he/she inacts the Training placement main office, which can control the other two entities without their consent.

We hope that you use our system and make changes according to your applications.
